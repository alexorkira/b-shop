# B(andicoot) Shop 

This B Shop is a little app that allow users to add very particular products into own basket in order to buy them (maybe one day) ... 

The project is splitted into a backend and a frontend part. Both of them have been developed using Typescript language

If you feel yourself a fan of Crash Bandicoot you must play with it! So download the entire project, install/run the backend first then the frontend using the following one shot command (once for both)

```
yarn && yarn start
```

and that's all. You can start shopping. Have fun! :wink:
